This included an aircon vehichle, a tour guide, entrance fee and lunch for both of us. We were under the impression that the submarine ride is the one that's increasing the price by so much( a city tour would have costed us ~3000 pesos) but upon our arrival we found that the submarine was actually costing 5000 pesos for two people only.The guide seemed to be uninformed of the places and failed to tell us the clear history of each monument. The city visit sites are all extremely close to each other and it absolutely did not make sense to us to pay so much for the tour, but we had already succumbed to the trap. Also at the start of the tour, we informed the guide that we are both vegetarians so our lunch should be vegetarian. But he took us to a seafood restaurant and then insisted that this is what we have. Then when we called the tour organizer she said that since we had not informed her about our vegetarian choice, we wont' be getting anything. After haggling so much we finally asked her to refund the money for lunch(initally she said 500 pesos for two which is extremely low, but finally we got her to agree to 1000 pesos for two ppl). Overall as tourists we feel cheated and mistreated. Highly disappointed. our overall philippines tour was excellent but i regret hiring them for our tour."

It would be unfair to single out anyone in particular because everyone carried out their duties to a Ã¢â‚¬Å“five starÃ¢â‚¬? level. I cannot express to you how delighted we were in the tour itself and the organization behind it. To say it went off like clockwork would be an understatement. We have already recommended KR Travel and Tours to some off our friends and will continue to recommend the use of KR to anyone we know who may wish to visit the Philippines, and we will certainly use KR again in the future.Please feel free to use or quote us in any advertising or promotional way in order to enhance KR Travel and Tours.\n\n\n\nOnce again many thanks for a fantastic time.\n\n\n\nS & B Carr\n\nSydney Australia"

Not a lot of white sand at the beach, but it was exactly like in the pictures, so I wasn't disappointed. The website and the menu said to put in your order early as they do not have any items pre-prepared and everything is made fresh. Only took about 20 minutes so that was great. If you are looking for a quiet place away from it all, then this place is for you."

This included an aircon vehichle, a tour guide, entrance fee and lunch for both of us. We were under the impression that the submarine ride is the one that's increasing the price by so much( a city tour would have costed us ~3000 pesos) but upon our arrival we found that the submarine was actually costing 5000 pesos for two people only.The guide seemed to be uninformed of the places and failed to tell us the clear history of each monument. The city visit sites are all extremely close to each other and it absolutely did not make sense to us to pay so much for the tour, but we had already succumbed to the trap. Also at the start of the tour, we informed the guide that we are both vegetarians so our lunch should be vegetarian. But he took us to a seafood restaurant and then insisted that this is what we have. Then when we called the tour organizer she said that since we had not informed her about our vegetarian choice, we wont' be getting anything. After haggling so much we finally asked her to refund the money for lunch(initally she said 500 pesos for two which is extremely low, but finally we got her to agree to 1000 pesos for two ppl). Overall as tourists we feel cheated and mistreated. Highly disappointed. our overall philippines tour was excellent but i regret hiring them for our tour."

It would be unfair to single out anyone in particular because everyone carried out their duties to a Ã¢â‚¬Å“five starÃ¢â‚¬? level. I cannot express to you how delighted we were in the tour itself and the organization behind it. To say it went off like clockwork would be an understatement. We have already recommended KR Travel and Tours to some off our friends and will continue to recommend the use of KR to anyone we know who may wish to visit the Philippines, and we will certainly use KR again in the future.Please feel free to use or quote us in any advertising or promotional way in order to enhance KR Travel and Tours.\n\n\n\nOnce again many thanks for a fantastic time.\n\n\n\nS & B Carr\n\nSydney Australia"

There were no crowds there and no noise. The rooms were clean and price was low. The staff was helpful and friendly and the food was delicious. Not a lot of white sand at the beach, but it was exactly like in the pictures, so I wasn't disappointed. The website and the menu said to put in your order early as they do not have any items pre-prepared and everything is made fresh. Only took about 20 minutes so that was great. If you are looking for a quiet place away from it all, then this place is for you."

        "reviewer_text": "Me and my husband booked the submarine+cebu city tour last minute with KR travels in Cebu. The total charge for the two of us was ~15000 pesos. This included an aircon vehichle, a tour guide, entrance fee and lunch for both of us. We were under the impression that the submarine ride is the one that's increasing the price by so much( a city tour would have costed us ~3000 pesos) but upon our arrival we found that the submarine was actually costing 5000 pesos for two people only.The guide seemed to be uninformed of the places and failed to tell us the clear history of each monument. The city visit sites are all extremely close to each other and it absolutely did not make sense to us to pay so much for the tour, but we had already succumbed to the trap. Also at the start of the tour, we informed the guide that we are both vegetarians so our lunch should be vegetarian. But he took us to a seafood restaurant and then insisted that this is what we have. Then when we called the tour organizer she said that since we had not informed her about our vegetarian choice, we wont' be getting anything. After haggling so much we finally asked her to refund the money for lunch(initally she said 500 pesos for two which is extremely low, but finally we got her to agree to 1000 pesos for two ppl). Overall as tourists we feel cheated and mistreated. Highly disappointed. our overall philippines tour was excellent but i regret hiring them for our tour."

It would be unfair to single out anyone in particular because everyone carried out their duties to a Ã¢â‚¬Å“five starÃ¢â‚¬? level. I cannot express to you how delighted we were in the tour itself and the organization behind it. To say it went off like clockwork would be an understatement. We have already recommended KR Travel and Tours to some off our friends and will continue to recommend the use of KR to anyone we know who may wish to visit the Philippines, and we will certainly use KR again in the future.Please feel free to use or quote us in any advertising or promotional way in order to enhance KR Travel and Tours.\n\n\n\nOnce again many thanks for a fantastic time.\n\n\n\nS & B Carr\n\nSydney Australia"
