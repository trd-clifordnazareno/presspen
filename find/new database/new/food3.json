The dough is very soft and the sweetness is just enough unlike its competition. The almonds and the white belgian chocolate combine with the donut gives a very pleasant taste.\nAbove it all they also have a very cozy place. Good for hang out or just relax while enjoying a bite of your donut."

Anti-mage iced tea - it did not taste like iced tea at all. It was water, sugar and some ice. It's not even cold.\n3. We had the Warlock's steak (more like tenderloin slices/ small pieces and not exactly a whole steak) - it took some time for them to serve it but it was not even close to warm when it was brought to our table. The serving portion is too small.\n4. Price - not worth the price at all. It's too expensive for a not cold iced tea, cold steak and...read more"

Just the perfect place to unwind dor its cozy furnitures and the home vibe it provides, true to itâ€™s name- Balai.\nFood was great but what I can really recommend are their drinks. Coffee is what they are really known first next was their roasted chicken."

Ambience was really nice, good place to catch up.\n\nHowever, we waited for almost two hours for our food to be complete. One of my friends got irritated since when we first followed up for our order, we sensed that they have forgotten about it and told us to wait since the kitchen was busy. We waited for another hour for a salad and a breakfast plate. I think it would be wise if staff would actually write down the customer's orders instead of just memorizing it.\n\nIf not for the food, I would think twice on coming back here."

The Japanese station was very sparse though - only maki was available. I'm usually used to a sashimi and tuna spread... Likewise, the fruits selection was great and super sweet.
